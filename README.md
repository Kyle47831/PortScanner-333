# PortScanner-333
Port Scanner

The script can be used for localhost, or a specific IP address.
In order to change what the target is just change what is input when Line 9 is prompted. 
In order to change which ports are being scanned the start and finish numbers in line 28 can be changed. 
If a list of only open ports is wanted delete lines 31 and 32. As it is, the script scans ports 100 through 200. 
This was done for the sake of speed; however, it can be edited to search whatever port range is desired.
